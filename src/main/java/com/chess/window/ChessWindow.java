 * Class: ChessWindow
 *
 * This class represents the main graphical window for a chess game, implemented
 * using JavaFX. It handles the initialization and display of the chessboard
 * and chess pieces, allowing the user to interact with the game by dragging
 * and dropping pieces. Key functionalities include:
 *
 * - Rendering the chessboard and pieces.
 * - Handling mouse events for selecting, moving, and dragging pieces.
 * - Updating the visual and logical state of the board after each move.
 * - Support for special moves such as castling.
 *
 * The chessboard is represented as an 8x8 grid, and piece images are loaded
 * dynamically based on their positions on the board. The class manages both
 * the internal game state and the visual representation.
